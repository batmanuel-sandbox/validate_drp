"""Measurement of AFx (x=1,2,3): The maximum fraction of astrometric
    distances which deviate by more than ADx milliarcsec (see AMx) (%).

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric : `lsst.validate.base.Metric`
        AF1, AF2 or AF3 `~lsst.validate.base.Metric` instance.
    matchedDataset : lsst.validate.drp.matchreduce.MatchedMultiVisitDataset
    amx : :class:`lsst.validate.drp.calcsrd.AMxMeasurement`
        And AMx measurement, providing the median astrometric scatter in
        the annulus.
    bandpass : str
        Bandpass (filter name) used in this measurement (e.g., `'r'`).
    spec_name : str
        Name of a specification level to measure against (e.g., design,
        minimum, stretch).
    verbose : bool, optional
        Output additional information on the analysis steps.
    job : :class:`lsst.validate.drp.base.Job`, optional
        If provided, the measurement will register itself with the Job
        object.
    linkedBlobs : dict, optional
        A `dict` of additional blobs (subclasses of BlobBase) that
        can provide additional context to the measurement, though aren't
        direct dependencies of the computation (e.g., `matchedDataset).

    Notes
    -----
    This table below is provided ``validate_drp``\ 's :file:`metrics.yaml`.

    LPM-17 dated 2011-07-06

    Specification:
        The rms of the astrometric distance distribution for
        stellar pairs with separation of D arcmin (repeatability)
        will not exceed AMx milliarcsec (median distribution for a large number
        of sources). No more than AFx % of the sample will deviate by more than
        ADx milliarcsec from the median. AMx, AFx, and ADx are specified for
        D=5, 20 and 200 arcmin for x= 1, 2, and 3, in the same order (Table 18).

    The three selected characteristic distances reflect the size of an
    individual sensor, a raft, and the camera. The required median astrometric
    precision is driven by the desire to achieve a proper motion accuracy of
    0.2 mas/yr and parallax accuracy of 1.0 mas over the course of the survey.
    These two requirements correspond to relative astrometric precision for a
    single image of 10 mas (per coordinate).
